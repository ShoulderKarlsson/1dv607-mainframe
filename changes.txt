Peer reviews, before and after


We’ve made some small changes to our diagram after we received the peer reviews. We added more space between the conceptual classes to increase readability. We also added a ‘date’ attribute to the conceptual class, Event. We think this change is relevant since every event is going to happen on a specific date.
