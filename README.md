## Final Passing Grade Domain Model:

There's now an association line from register to the conceptual class 'boat', instead of 'member'. Booking now registers the Boat, that a member owns, instead of registrating a member that owns a boat.

## Peer reviews, before and after

**Before:**

We’ve made some small changes to our diagram after we received the peer reviews. We added more space between the conceptual classes to increase readability. We also added a ‘date’ attribute to the conceptual class, Event. We think this change is relevant since every event is going to happen on a specific date. 


**After:**
